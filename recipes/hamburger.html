    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A hamburger is a food consisting of fillings —usually a patty of ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>Ground meat</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Ground beef</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The best burgers are made from freshly ground, high-grade beef chuck in an 80/20 mix (meat to fat). Spread the beef out flat and season with salt and pepper. If you have a secret ingredient like Worcestershire sauce or chopped bacon, add it now. Toss together gently. You don't want to overmix.</li>
        <li>Grab 5 to 6 ounces of meat and lightly toss from hand to hand, forming a ball.</li>    
        <li>The patty should be at least as wide as your bun and about 3/4 to 1 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Make a divot in the middle of the burger with your thumb to help it keep its shape while cooking. These patties can be made ahead and chilled in the fridge.</li>
        <li>Preheat the grill to medium or medium-high over direct heat. Oil the grate with a neutral-flavored oil like canola or vegetable. When the oil begins to smoke, it's hot enough to add the burgers. Make sure your burgers are at room temperature, and season them again with salt and pepper. Put the burgers on the grill and let them be. The less touching, the better the burger. For a juicier burger, resist the urge to press down. Cover the grill.</li>
        <li>It's time to flip when the burger releases from the grate without sticking.</li>
        <li>For medium burgers, cook for about 5 minutes per side. For well-done, go a little longer.</li>
        <li>To add cheese, move the burgers to the cooler side of the grill, top with cheese and cover the grill for a minute to let the cheese melt. Place the patties on buns, add other toppings and serve.</li>
    </ul>
